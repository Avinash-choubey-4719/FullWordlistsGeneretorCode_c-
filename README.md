A word list is just what it says it is. It is a list of words. Words that may or may not match someoneâ€™s password.
Some of them contain commonly used passwords that have long been known to be the most commonly used passwords, 
and some of them are lists of passwords from leaks of hacked databases. You would use a wordlist to attempt to crack a password using a dictionary attack.

Torrent sites typically have large wordlists you can download, but if you do some google searching you will find a lot of websites with various wordlists.
